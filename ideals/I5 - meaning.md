“A problem shared is a problem halved.”
Discuss your problems with someone and then the two of you are more likely to come up with a solution.

"When the game is over, the king and the pawn go back into the same box
fear is a short pain. Regret lasts a lot longer

You cannot change the past, but you can change how you percieve it, what you draw out of it.
## Meaning

“A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the "why" for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any "how".”
― Victor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning

It also helps to make sure tasks are connected to something you care about for its own sake,22 at least through a chain: you read the book so you can pass the test so you can get the grade so you can get the job you want and have a fulfilling career. Breaking the chain leaves a task feeling meaningless.

Every time we act, we amplify the underlying idea or tendency.

If we wish to conquer undesirable emotional tendencies in ourselves, we must assiduously, and in the first instance cold-bloodedly, go through the outward motions of those contrary dispositions we prefer to cultivate. William James

Pennebaker’s research and the importance of self-disclosing traumatic events to other people or a diary. Newer research on trauma writing suggests that it is not so much telling someone about the event, as it is constructing a narrative to explain what happened. That is, the key factor involved is making-sense-of.

Adaption
hedonic adaptation—“the observed tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes.”
At first, we react strongly to changes in circumstances, but, over time, their emotional impacts lose their power. We take good things for granted. We overcome obstacles. In both cases, we may freak out in the beginning, but then move on as if it were no big deal. In other words, we adapt.

To comprehend and cope with our environments we develop models of them. These models drive all behaviour ranging from decisions down to habilitual  or instinctive if-then behaviours. This is because the if condition is triggered by the recognition of something in the model.

We don't see the world as it is we see the world as we expect it to be and use our observations to better align our models.

Passion

Of course, the most powerful way to increase the value of a task is to focus on doing what you love wherever possible. It doesn't take much extra motivation for me to research meta-ethics or write summaries of scientific self-help: that is what I love to do. Some people who love playing video games have made careers out of it. To figure out which career might be full of tasks that you love to do, taking a RIASEC personality test might help. In the USA, O\*NET can help you find jobs that are in-demand and fit your personality.

As Paul Graham points out, a lot of the cool things that have been accomplished in the past weren’t done through self-discipline:

> One of the most dangerous illusions you get from school is the idea that doing great things requires a lot of discipline. Most subjects are taught in such a boring way that it's only by discipline that you can flog yourself through them. ... I'm not saying you can get away with zero self-discipline. You probably need about the amount you need to go running. I'm often reluctant to go running, but once I do, I enjoy it. And if I don't run for several days, I feel ill. It's the same with people who do great things. They know they'll feel bad if they don't work, and they have enough discipline to get themselves to their desks to start working. But once they get started, interest takes over, and discipline is no longer necessary. Do you think Shakespeare was gritting his teeth and diligently trying to write Great Literature? Of course not. He was having fun. That's why he's so good. - [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html)

Paul Graham on "How to do what you love":
It used to perplex me when I read about people who liked what they did so much that there was nothing they'd rather do. There didn't seem to be any sort of work I liked that much. If I had a choice of (a) spending the next hour working on something or (b) be teleported to Rome and spend the next hour wandering about, was there any sort of work I'd prefer? Honestly, no.
But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn't mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.
Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.
As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure. You have to like what you do enough that the concept of "spare time" seems mistaken. Which is not to say you have to spend all your time working. You can only work so much before you get tired and start to screw up. Then you want to do something else—even something mindless. But you don't regard this time as the prize and the time you spend working as the pain you endure to earn it.
I put the lower bound there for practical reasons. If your work is not your favorite thing to do, you'll have terrible problems with procrastination. You'll have to force yourself to work, and when you resort to that the results are distinctly inferior.
Another quote from Paul Graham:
The way to work for long periods on something is to be interested in it. Few to no people have the discipline to make themselves work on something that bores them for many hours straight without paging it out. Probably none of the people whose work I admire do. Their trick is to work on stuff they like
The latter is the type of rationalization that Paul talked about in his recent essay Self-Indulgence, where the wost time-wasters are those that don't feel like time-wasters:
The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.
And yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day—days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work.

“Remember: Oppression thrives off isolation. Connection is the only thing that can save you. Remember: Oppression thrives on superficiality. Honesty about your struggles is the key to your liberation. Remember: Your story can help save someone’s life. Your silence contributes to someone else’s struggle. Speak so we can all be free. Love so we all can be liberated. The moment is now. We need you.”-Yolo Akili

Passion and problem solving, and so much more, are apart of the human drive and desire for fulfillment. Earlier, they made an interesting insight into how working toward mastery of some kind, heightens the experience of the thing itself. I know in college I loved my 'Gen-Eds',  but as I finally declared my majors and focused on them, their beauty unfolded, and as I began to take command, all the passion and relationships between myself and the the craft and the world itself, revealed themselves. More succinctly (echoing what they said), I liked these majors more as I got better at them. Anyway, that was a long winded way of saying: truth and world view, are the majors, and introspection and creative/expressive pursuits can be the 'getting better at them.'
You don't find passion. You create it. Exploring a domain makes you see it differently. 
Gaining mastery is a fundamental part of creating passion. Because this unlocks flow. Doing well at something is enjoyable.

Agency is driven by friction of both ideals (I didn't know that was possible or learned helplessness I could never do that) and friction of action being able to turn ideas into implementation and get them working in reality.

Intelligence is a large aspect of agency which is why a super intelligent AI is uncontrollable. It would be able to do things that you can't fathom or think are impossible, e.g. put you into a hypnotic trance and you make you do what it wants.

Responsibilities and duties are the most significant reducers of agency. Therefore, it is important to choose them well. Responsibilities, duties and passions are the keystones of vitality. They imbue life with meaning. They put in front of you things worth pursuing.

Discipline, exploration and safe failures are the antecedents of increased agency because they lead to master or less friction.

With meaning you end pursuing your own path and that is where the most gains are as that is where there is the least competition. There is only one you.

Synergy has lead to humans becoming interdependent
Humanities evolutionary path has not been one of becoming faster or stronger, but of instead becoming better able to utilise synergy. Humans have come to dominate this planet, not through being faster or stronger, but through being more intelligent and capable of social interconnection.  The ability to coordinate needs, thoughts and feelings greatly expanded humanities survival options.

It is not that humans became stronger

Humanity has evolved in an environment where not being part of a tribe has meant almost certain death. Therefore, we have become wired for social connection. To be human is to need others both physically as well as emotionally and psychologically.



To be human is to need others.


This means that being human means to need others.
Limitation, specialisation, intelligence and variance all lead to interdependence because they present synergistic opportunities. That is, opportunities in which we can work with others to achieve more than we ever could alone. 

Interdependence can be something hard to accept and relationships can be hard to maintain. Therefore, synergy while beneficial is something that is rarely realised. This makes synergy an ideal, something we are directed towards yet rarely reaching.


have no claws, and in doing so we also became fundamentally interdependent. Being part of a tribe is integral to our survival. This is not only true physically it is also true emotionally and psychologically. To be human is to need others, for example, without touch and personal affection a significant portion of babies will die. 

We not only need others we are better with others. 

Attachment

Attachment theory, developed by Bowlby (1969, 1973), conceptualizes the biological tendency of infants to establish an afectional bond with their primary caretakers within the frst year of life. The resultant attachment system forms the basis of people’s internal working models of close relationships that persist from early childhood throughout adulthood, with some
degree of malleability. Bowlby indicated that when the person perceives the attachment fgure as available and responsive to proximity-seeking behavior, she experiences a sense of attachment security, perceiving the attachment fgure as trustworthy and reliable. These nurturing and attuned relational experiences foster positive internal representations of self and others that
enhance self-confdence and trust in the attachment figures readiness to ofer support. Bowlby (1988) believed that attachment security (i.e., secure attachment) not only engenders a positive self-image and facilitates the development of mutually satisfying relationships but also allows the individual to explore
and pursue non-attachment activities, such as sex.
Bowlby (1969, 1973) posited that due to biological pres-
sures, children form attachments to their caregivers even if the caregiver is inconsistent, unresponsive, rejecting, neglectful, or abusive. Individuals who experience such disruptions in their attachment system tend to develop negative internal working models of self or others and adopt one of two defensive strategies of insecure attachment: hyperactivation or deactivation of the attachment system. Preoccupied with threats of
abandonment, separation and betrayal, and apprehension that the attachment fgure will be unavailable to meet their needs, anxiously attached individuals tend to engage in hyperactivating attachment behaviors, which Bowlby called “protest”—
frenzied, unrelenting attempts to elicit caretaking behaviors in the attachment figure, including clinging, controlling, and forceful behaviors. A hyperactivated individual remains hypervigilant to any threats of abandonment, separation, and betrayal, which inadvertently and inevitably generates rela-
tional confict thereby reinforcing feelings of insecurity. In a stance that Bowlby termed “compulsive self-reliance” (Bowlby, 1969), avoidantly attached individuals engage in deactivating behaviors characterized by the inhibition of proximity-seeking
behaviors and maintenance of physical and emotional distance. Avoidantly attached individuals disregard threats to the relationship and avoid intimacy and interdependence when coping with attachment needs.

Attachment measures a person’s ability to connect to other human beings.

Healthy attachment means a person connects to others with an expectation of emotional security. The person with healthy attachment does not worry they will be abandoned or forgotten because they know others will think of them even while they are apart and will make decisions with their wellbeing in mind. They do not worry when disagreements arise because they know they are connected at a deeper level. Mistakes aren’t feared because the attached person knows they’ll be given a chance to explain their mistake and make things right. Vulnerability is relatively easy because a person with healthy attachment believes others have their best interests at heart.

In short, a person with healthy attachment believes love is freely given instead of earned, that others love them for who they are, that people will continue to love them even in their absence, and that love cannot be casually destroyed.

Unhealthy attachment means a person struggles to believe in any emotional security, so vulnerability to others becomes dangerous and fearful. In fact, vulnerability is utterly terrifying because it could lead to judgment and abandonment as secret imperfections are revealed. Vulnerability may even lead to outright victimization by those around them. The detached person struggles constantly with worries of abandonment and being forgotten because they don’t believe others really love them for who they are, only for the services they perform. They believe decisions others make will usually conflict with their own needs because the people they love don’t think about them enough to remember their wellbeing, or else they just aren’t important enough to consider. Disagreements and mistakes are often the end of relationships to them because they believe they’ll be abandoned and rejected instantly upon displaying imperfection and will be given no chance to explain or make amends.

In short, a person with unhealthy attachment believes others only love them for the services they perform, that love must be continuously earned, that people will actively fall out of love with them every moment they are not refilling the person’s pleasure meter, and that love can be accidentally destroyed by the slightest mistake.


Attachment styles form as a result of the young mind trying to understand one thing: Will I be loved for who I am, or do I have to earn love?

This complicated question is boiled down to a simple black-or-white equation because the young mind is not capable of nuance. At 3 months old, an infant only knows its mother is not responding to its cries. At 3 years old, a toddler doesn’t understand that daddy is hitting him because daddy has alcohol problems. At 10 years old, a little girl doesn’t understand that she’s been abandoned because her parents have mental health issues.

To the little mind, everything that happens is about them. Everything that happens is a direct result of the child’s behavior and quality. Therefore, abuse and neglect and abandonment make the child believe:

“I deserve this.”

“No one will ever treat me better than my parents, and even they couldn’t love me.”

“I will not be loved because I don’t deserve to be loved. But maybe I can earn love if I’m good enough.”
"I don't want to not live because of my fear of what could happen..." ~Laird Hamilton

“There is something inside me that others can see, something horrible that makes it so others can’t love me. I don’t know what the bad thing is, so I don’t know what I can’t show people. I need to lock down and keep everything inside so people won’t see this horrible thing and abandon me.”

Any serious disruption in early life can create an attachment wound.

Divorce, where the family is ripped apart and the child is told “sometimes love just doesn’t last”
Abuse, where the child learns they can be hurt by anyone at any time and no one will protect them
Daycare in significant amounts and especially early in infancy, where the child is separated from their parents and must compete with others for attention and love, and where the workers change based on shifts or employment disruptions so the formed attachments disappear
Parental neglect or emotional distance, where the child doesn’t understand why their parents seem to want nothing to do with them and don’t invest time or emotional energy in the child
All these occurrences can send the message to a child’s brain that they are the cause for their own loneliness and that they are not worthy of being loved. As irrational as it may seem, the child’s brain truly believes the parents would not get divorced and split the household if they could have loved the child enough, or that abuse would not have happened if the child was better behaved.
