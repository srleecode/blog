“Practice doesn't make perfect.
Practice reduces the imperfection.”
― Toba Beta, Master of Stupidity 

I believe that the greatest mathematical accomplishment is Gödel's incompletess theorem. It's the embodiment of the realization that knowledge, what humanity thrives for, is actually very limited. We don't know everything, and we can't know everything.

Our rationalisation of ideas we think are true or right is the basis and origination of reason not a flaw. https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/theory-knowledge/201808/the-enigma-reason-brief-review “reasoning is primarily a social, rather than an individual, tool. Here the purpose of reasoning is not inquisitive, but instead justificatory – we provide reasons to other people, and we evaluate the reasons provided by other people. The niche of reasoning is in the highly social world of human cooperative groups, a niche where it is highly advantageous to be able to transfer information and trust between individuals who are not kin” https://mindhacks.com/2017/07/06/the-enigma-of-reason-review/ We produce reasons in order to justify our thoughts and actions to others and to produce arguments to convince others to think and act as we suggest. We also use reason to evaluate not so much our own thought as the reasons others produce to justify themselves or to convince us. The function of Reason seems to be to justify our intuitions, not matter how silly they are. Because of the interactionist model: Reason is a social module. Its function is epistemic vigilance—to evaluate the claims of others (and build your own arguments in anticipation of such interactions). This fits the evidence and makes evolutionary sense: we need such a module lest we become helpless recipients of the deception of others, or unable to receive their good advice.


“It always seems impossible until it's done.” ― Nelson Mandela 

Bayes rule in a nutshell is a theroem that decribes how your confidence in an idea should change overtime as you encounter new evidence.

By default the brain is coherence based, we take in information, we look at our beliefs and we ask: are they coherent. If they are, then that belief feels right and we are likely to accept it. 

This way of thinking leads to things like the base rate neglect fallcy which is demonstrated in the follwoing example. If you saw a student that was shy would you think that they were more likely to be studying for a maths PHD or a business bachelor degree. Most people would think about this in terms of coherence and most people would view shyness as more coherent with the concept of a maths PHD student than a business school student. Therefore, they would think the maths PHD student was more likely. This is not the right question though. While it is probably true that there are more shy people who are studying for maths PHDs let's say it is 60% of the total and 15% of the total business school students are shy. There is significantly more business school students than there are maths PHD students which means it is more likely that the shy student is a business school student. 

By default, we try to try to confirm or refute a blief. That is, we look for evidence coherent with that belief. This is known as confirmation bias. Being bayesian is about looking for the best theory. It is not about asking if the evidence is coherent with a belief, but is about asking which belief is it most coherent with. 

A bayesian goes a setp further. They ask would this evidence be better explained with some other theory or maybe just as well with some other theory. Does the evidence actually help prove the theory or does it just align with the theory. 

A bayesian sees evidence not as something that confirms a theory, but as something that can confirm or refute with different strengths many theories. To a bayesian the current pet theory no matter how well liked is just a single candidate.

A conseuqnce of thinking in terms of multiple possible theories is that you become more aware that your beliefs are grayscale, they're not black and white. What we call "impossible" is just something that no evidence has been encountered yet to show that it is possible, but this could change. If the prior is equal to 1 (absolute belief) or the prior is equal to 0 (absolute denial), no amount of evidence, no matter how convincing can ever bring about a change in belief. A rational person always leave room on either end of the scale.

A second consequence is that that you become aware that you have levels of confidence in your beliefs and that those levels of confidence fluctuate as you encounter new ideas and evidence.

One final consequence is that it becomes easier to discard beliefs. The outside perspective, e.g. asking what would I advise another person to do if they were in the same situation, becomes more natural. It is a very common scenario for people to believe things more stronly that the evidence dictates. This can be because you might think it would be embarassing to be wrong or you may might have alreadyy invested alot based on the belief that your theory was right. This is known as the sunk cost fallacy in which we are often commited to particular ideas, so don't consider options that would be consider if you took an outside perspective. 


 -  what are the priors. Avoid base rate neglect


bayesion updating - we think in terms of coherence. Bayesian thinking is different
    - what are the priors. Avoid base rate neglect
    - how likely would it be that the opposite was true

Quality models have less friction, but are more costly to create. For explicit models, these costs are in terms of deliberation and the exploration done in order to find wide range of objective sources of information that provide multiple perspectives on the subject. They also require cognitive costs in order to control yourself to ensure you act rationally and rely on objective rather than subjective influences, e.g. emotions. For implicit models, these costs are in terms of time and effort to repeatedly try to do a task successfully. In both cases the models created start with less friction and accrue less friction over time than other less quality models would.

Implicit and explicit models are both useful. Implicit models are the natural form of models. Explicit models are good because they can be expressed.

What does quality mental models mean?

> Time present and time past
> Are both perhaps present in time future,
> And time future contained in time past. - T.S Eliot [Four Quartets](http://www.davidgorman.com/4quartets/1-norton.htm)

In an acorn lies the potentiality of an oak tree, given the right circumstances. so its end its destiny is in its beginning and in its beginning is the end. Models contain futures and pasts.

> All time is unredeemable.
> What might have been is an abstraction
> Remaining a perpetual possibility
> Only in a world of speculation. - T.S Eliot [Four Quartets](http://www.davidgorman.com/4quartets/1-norton.htm)

A model is theoretical. It's future is precarious. It's an abstraction only a potential possibility that exists in a world of
speculation. It doesn't have a solid reality and so we must always be bringing into the present or aligning it with reality. Reconstructing it using what you we now know so as to reduce its friction.

How do you know if a computer program is badly designed? You don’t go through a mental checklist; instead, you feel disgust, coloured by your experience.
Think of learning to ride a bicycle. Think of how difficult it is to communicate what you know to a child just beginning to take off her training wheels.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence

The reason for this is the same reason that attempting to learn how to ride a bicycle by reading a book is stupid. The most valuable mental models do not survive codification. They cannot be expressed through words alone.

Lam, 2000 summaries the three qualities of tacit knowledge:

    (First): Knowledge which is tacit is intuitive and unarticulated. It resides in Popper’s ‘World two’ where knowledge cannot be communicated, understood, or used without the ‘knowing subject’. (…) This is particularly true of operational skills and know-how acquired through practical experience. Knowledge of this type is action-oriented and has a personal quality that makes it difficult to formalize or communicate.

    Second, the main methods for the acquisition and accumulation of these two knowledge forms also differ. Explicit knowledge can be generated through logical deduction and acquired by formal study. Tacit knowledge, in contrast, can only be acquired through the practical experience in the relevant context i.e. ‘learning-by-doing’.

    Third, the two forms of knowledge differ in their potential for aggregation and modes of appropriation. Explicit knowledge can be aggregated at a single location, stored in objective forms and appropriated without the participation of the knowing subject. Tacit knowledge, in contrast, is personal and contextual. It is distributive, and cannot be easily aggregated. The realization of its full potential requires the close involvement and cooperation of the knowing subject.

5 second rule. You not only need theoretical knowledge you need it engrained and at a deep level. It needs to be intuitive finger tip feel. You can't figure it all out in the moment

you cannot learn the mental models that are responsible for success through reading and thinking.

mental models that are explicit knowledge and mental models that are tacit knowledge.

Experts You also need to have the iceberg under that model — their tacit knowledge of how to apply it, when to apply it, and what can be ignored in which situations.

    experience precedes technical knowledge. We may read books or articles that present technical instructions before we have ever lifted a racket, but where did these instructions come from? At some point did they not originate in someone’s experience? Either by accident or by intention someone hit a ball in a certain way and it felt good and it worked. Through experimentation, refinements were made and finally settled into a repeatable stroke.

    Perhaps in the interest of being able to repeat that way of hitting the ball again or to pass it on to another, the person attempts to describe that stroke in language. But words can only represent actions, ideas and experiences. Language is not the action, and at best can only hint at the subtlety and complexity contained in the stroke. Although the instruction thus conceived can now be stored in the part of the mind that remembers language, it must be acknowledged that remembering the instruction is not the same as remembering the stroke itself.

This applies not just to tennis, but to all of technê.

business is most likely a form of technê — a skill that can be learnt by a combination of apprenticeship and practice.
The common element to all of this is that true success is not in learning explicit mental models, but in developing tacit ones. The explicit models are merely the tip of the iceberg, poking above the ocean, hiding a huge mass of competency beneath.

Read from the source material of master practitioners, copy their actions, climb their skill trees, and reflect through trial and error. Don't read third-party accounts of technê.

Deliberate practice pioneer K. Anders Ericsson argues that mental representations lie at the heart of all expert performance.
Once you understand this idea — that human expertise consists of mental models that we construct internally from things we already know — you should begin to see several implications that arise naturally from Piaget’s theory.
One direct implication is that frameworks do not make for competence. I can tell you my framework for employee retention, but that is not the same thing as being able to use it in your own practice.

Humans learn based on what they already know.
