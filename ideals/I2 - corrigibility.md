# Corrigibility

> When change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen; when the need for change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult and time consuming. - David Collingridge, The Control of Technology (NY, St. Martin’s Press, 1980)

> A decision is easy to correct, or highly corrigible, when, if it is mistaken, the mistake can be discovered quickly and cheaply and when the mistake imposes only small costs which can be eliminated quickly and at little expense. - David Collingridge, The Control of Technology (NY, St. Martin’s Press, 1980)

Organizations with predictable environments can exploit that predictability with fixed structures. These fixed structures allow efficiency. With predictable situations you can find and close off unvaluable paths of inquiry quickly. You cannot do this in complex situations as they are not predictable. In complex situations, you must rely on experimentation and adaptation. This means you must explore paths of inquiry to discover their worth. This exploration may end up being wasteful as the explored path can turn out to be unvaluable. This "waste" is an unavoidable part of operating in complex situations and is what causes complex situations to have asymmetric payoffs.

As organisations become more complex, the frequency of wrong decisions increases. Teams today, therefore, need to maximize their ability to be able to change and to be able to reverse decisions if they are proven to be wrong. This ability is referred to as "corrigibility".

Corrigibility is a term that means capable of being corrected, reformed or improved. Corrigibility is a response to uncertainty and unpredictability, especially when the costs to undo a decision will be high. If the effects of a decision cannot be predicted, then the optimal approach is to maximize the ability to reverse that decision if it gets proven to be wrong. It is often the case that the risks or opportunities present in a situation increase over time. Therefore, some action is demanded. This action must be taken even though all the tools and evidence might not yet be available to correctly decide which action to take. Corrigibility is intended to deal with this situation. The problem of having to make make decisions in an environment of ignorance, and in essence boils down to: "take small steps and have an exit strategy". the greater the uncertainty the more resources you should apply to incremental exploration of that space and the more prepared you should be to reverse out of a specific design path. Make the best decision you can with the tools and evidence available to you, but be ready to pivot.

Corrigibility is a fundamental part of programming as a large portion of development time is spent in trial and error.

Some common ways in which corrigibility is achieved is through:

- Minimising the impact² of change by reducing the scope of the change
- Minimising WIP
- Maintaining a wide range of alternatives so that you have options to fall back to if the current path turns out to be untenable,
- Making commitments³, especially those that reduce agency, as late as possible
- Exploring in order to reduce the likelihood of having to reverse out of a decision.
- Humility³ which acts as the antidote to arrogance. Arrogance stops course correction. Mistakes are amplified by the number of people who blindly follow decisions without question. Where someone's experience and perspective has value you want them to be able to provide their perspective and input. Teams should be chasing customer value, not ego satiation and that value is delivered by everyone in the team. Therefore, everyone should have an input. You want everyone to be capable of taking on the hero archtype. That is, someone who can find some area for potential improvement explore it and then return with valuable insights.

When one looks at different ways of structuring teams and projects for different types of work, the solutions are often presented as a dichotomy. For example:

- In software development, the choice will be between Agile or the traditional software development approach which is planning heavy with long release cycles and linear discrete stages in development.
- In a military context, the choice will be between mission command (leading through vision and empowerment) or detailed command (leading through detailed instructions)
  The two different solutions tend to have the following attributes:

The right side is about strategies that allow and exploit predictability and the left side is about strategies that deal with the repercussions of having a limited ability to predict. For example, agile as a whole is about adopting a posture that allows you to respond rapidly to changing market conditions and customer demands. The agile posture takes predictability and plans as something of limited value. That is, it views friction as something that increases rapidly.
The problem with the dichotomy view discussed above is that systems are not static and neither is how we perceive and interact with them. They change and the problems that arise from dealing with them change. For example, you get different problems when you work with different parts of the system or when you learn from interacting with the system or when you view the system at different levels of abstraction.

A consequence of this is that when you are considering how a company should be organized it is a good idea to keep in mind the contingency theory which is an organizational theory that claims that there is no best way to organize a corporation, to lead a company or to make decisions. Instead, the optimal course of action is contingent (dependent) upon the internal and external situation.

According to contingency theory, the structure of an organization or of a team should depend upon the kind of task it typically performs. Routine tasks suggest specialization, formalization, hierarchy and centralized power; while non-routine tasks are better performed under the opposite conditions. As organizations change over time, the optimal structure for them will also change. For example, when an organization is in the initial development phase of a product or a manufacturing process the organization should have a non-bureaucratic structure, but once manufacturing starts the structure of the organization should change to reflect the new character of the work. At the team level, changes are also required as they go through different phases, e.g. knowledge acquisition and knowledge utilization phases, which lead to different types of problems and, therefore, different types of optimal organizational structures.
Deciding to adopt a “one-size-fits-all” process or process framework for different kinds of systems or for the same system over a long period of time or through all subsections of the systems is a perilous and inefficient decision. One should instead adopt and adapt processes in accordance with the problems one faces.

An example is modularisation. We can look at the benefits of this through the lens of microservices. Using modularisation:

- Development time should be shortened because separate groups can work on each module (microservice) with little need for communication.
- Product flexibility (agility) should be improved as you can make quite drastic changes or improvements in one module (microservice) without changing others.
- Comprehensibility improves as the system can be studied one microservice at a time with the result that the whole system could be better designed because it is better understood.

A commitment is a promises that will need to be kept by a future version of yourself which could be drastically different in terms of its ability or desire to keep that promise.

Commitments by their nature require solid predictions because if things change you can easily be left in an unfavorable or undesirable position, committed to something impossible or deeply undesirable. In complex environments, solid predictions are rare and become rarer as the length of time involved with the prediction increases. This is why it is wise to delay commitments until the latest time possible and to explore the domain before making strong commitments. Unfortunately, decisions and commitments must often be made and all you can do is use the tools available in the moment to move in the right direction. Life requires commitments. We have to make a lot of decisions from which we can't go back as the act of making the decision changes who we are. Some examples are: having children, getting married, choosing a career or course of study. These decisions are deeply defining and meaningful for people and yet they need to be made from positions of great uncertainty

It’s obvious that all of our scientific knowledge is an approximation of truth. Inevitably future generations with more advanced tools will make today’s theories irrelevant. The fact that a scientific idea can create functional objects in the world says nothing about the absolute truth of the underlying theory (Ex: Newton) when one accepts the presupposition that human beings matter the most.

> It is imperative in science to doubt; it is absolutely necessary, for progress in science, to have uncertainty as a fundamental part of your inner nature. To make progress in understanding, we must remain modest and allow that we do not know. – Richard Feynman
