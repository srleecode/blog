“There are none so blind as those who will not see.”
It's useless explaining to those who do not want to understand.

"You	all	know	the	saying	‘seeing	is	believing’	I	
would	argue	that	other	times	things	need	to	be	
believed	in	to	be	seen.	Our	narrative	changes	
our	behavior	which	changes	reality"		
-	Andrew Lo

Those who excel are often overcompensating. Running from something, hiding from something. A lack, an unmet need leads to great motivation.

What separates successful from non successful people is often focus. Focus is something that we all recognize, but is innately difficult due to the spreading activation nature of the brain. Focus has become more complicated and difficult over time. It has gotten more difficult due to their being more enticing distractions around today and a greater tendency to work in larger and larger teams. This makes focus more difficult as it only not one person that needs to be focused, but multiple.

Focus is important because Resources are also limited, therefore, it is important at the individual and team level that we focus on the areas where we can most deliver value.

We do this through using automation and delegation are used extensively and appropriately.
the domains that we now operate are too complicated and complex for us to be able to excel in all of them.

Alot of successful people have a todo list.
A lot of very successful people have a not to do list. They know their weaknesses and things that lead to waste

_Flow state_

"Flow, also known as the zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement and enjoyment in the process of the activity. It's a state of perfect fccus where you're not conciously thinking about things or deliberating. It's a state of relaxed high performance.

Repetition is the way to achieve flow as you need to be able to perform the task without cognitive control. When you are first learning, it all requires cogntivie control. As you become an expert, that activity moves into the subconcious.

> Learn the rules, master them and then finally forget them - Miles davis

> “Master your instrument, Master the music, and then forget all that bullshit and just play.” - Charlie Parker

For example, to play piano in flow you need to first practice relentlessly. Piano playing cant be any short of perfect, or brain will have to think about sequences, rather then exploration. learn the rules to playing piano technically perfect and apply until you do play technically perfect. Then forget the rules. '
Essentially, with it you have the craft of piano playing minus the dogma how HOW someone else wants you to play it. That leaves space for your brain to make his own space and pace. And brain works best on its own terms.
You get to explore. Thats what flow is.

Cant achieve it without brutal hard work.

_Names_

Our minds do lots of things; they carry many thoughts, and we can recall many memories. Some of these phenomena may be more helpful for our goals, and we may want to name them. When we name a phenomenon, like Focusing, we’re essentially drawing a boundary around the thing, highlighting attention on it. We’ve made it conceptually discrete. This transformation, in turn, allows us to more concretely identify which things among the sea of our mental activity correspond to Focusing. Focusing can then become a concept that floats in our understanding of things our minds can do. We’ve taken a mental action and packaged it into a “thing”. This can be especially helpful if we’ve identified a phenomena that consists of several steps which usually aren’t found together.

Names haves power in the same way that abstraction barriers have power in a programming language—they change how you think about the phenomena itself, and this in turn can affect your behavior.

_Scheduling or defining boundaries_
Scheduling only when you know your bounds can you schedule properly.
Boundaries
goals
Quality goals have realisable targets, that progress you towards an ideal and allow for high quality feedback structures.

Realisability is not only about physical capability, but is also about motivation. A goal is not realisable if you will not be motivated enough to achieve it.

_Losing focus_

Losing focus is also important as you can then see other paths rather than being fixated and myopic

¹ A common definition of good goals is that they should be SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound). This is true, but it is a slightly superfluous definition that is also missing some important aspects which are tied to how human motivation works. . The issues with this definition are that:
 -  attainable is redundant due to there also being realistic
 -  specific is redundant due to their also being measurable and time-anchored
 -  it doesn't mention that goals should be challenging. A goal that is too easy is not going to allow you to progress towards the ideal or get into states of flow
 -  it doesn't mention that goals should be meaningful and connected to things you desire

Realisable

It's also important to break up goals into lots of smaller subgoals which, by themselves, are easier to achieve and have more immediate deadlines. Typically, daily goals are frequent enough, but it can also help to set an immediate goal to break you through the "getting started" threshold. Your first goal can be "Write the email to the producer," and your next goal can be the daily goal. Once that first, 5 minute task has been completed, you'll probably already be on your way to the larger daily goal, even if it takes 30 minutes or 2 hours.

Realisability is not only a matter of physical capability, but also of motivation. Will you be motivated enough to do it.

MOTIVATION = EXPECTANCY x VALUE / IMPULSIVENESS x DELAY

Value is both positive and negative. 
(Expectancy x positive valence) - (expectancy x negative valence)

https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Piers_Steel/publication/280025762_The_Building_Blocks_of_Motivation/links/55a4401208aef604aa03d573/The-Building-Blocks-of-Motivation.pdf
The more rewarding the outcome, and the higher your expectancy of achieving that outcome, the more motivated you’ll be.  Conversely, decrease your impulsiveness, and decrease the delay of the expected reward.

Different people procrastinate for different reasons, corresponding to the different variables in the Procrastination Equation: Motivation = (Expectancy x Value) / (Impulsiveness x Delay). Procrastination results from lowering Motivation too much.
Expectancy = how likely you think you are to reach your goal
Value = the value you place on the goal
Impulsiveness = how influenced you are by short-term vs. long-term gratifications
Delay = how far into the future the goal is

Expectancy. Do you expect to succeed? Are you confident in your ability to achieve a great outcome in whatever you aspire to do? If your expectancy is high, then you’ll be more motivated and you’ll procrastinate less. It’s only natural: you’re more motivated to pursue something that gives you a good chance of having a pleasing outcome.
Value. Do you care about the specific task? Do you value it? The more rewarding an outcome is, the more motivated you’ll be to pursue it.
Impulsiveness. This refers to your sensitivity to delay. The more impulsive you are, the less willing you are to delay gratification. The more impulsive you are, the more you value immediate rewards over long-term rewards.
 > proximity to temptation is one of the deadliest determinants of procrastination. [And] the more enticing the distraction, the less work we do. - Dr. Piers Steel The Procrastination Equation
Delay. This indicates how long you must wait to receive the expected rewards, benefits, payouts. The longer you have to wait, the less motivated you’ll be and the more likely you are to procrastinate.
A failure in motivation is called procrastination
procrastination in a nutshell — a battle of impulse versus willpower, emotion versus reason, automatic versus controlled, experiential versus rational, and short-term pleasure versus long-term happiness. It’s a battle between your rational self and your monkey self, between the part of you who wants to be healthy and the part of you who wants to eat candy all day long.

Dr. Piers Steel, a leading procrastination researcher, puts it like this in his book The Procrastination Equation:
“…proximity to temptation is one of the deadliest determinants of procrastination. [And] the more enticing the distraction, the less work we do.”

A few decades ago, temptations were a lot less enticing. There were no smartphones, no social media, no 500-channel televisions, no video games, and so on.

Speciﬁcally, research on goal setting found thatcommitted, challenging, proximal, and speciﬁc goals lead to ahigher level of task performance (Bandura, 1997; Locke & Latham,2006).

Hundreds of books stress SMART goals: goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-Anchored.30 Is this recommendation backed by good research? Not quite.

Also: Are your goals measuring inputs or outputs? Is your goal to spend 30 minutes on X or is it to produce final product X? Try it different ways for different tasks, and see what works for you.

Because we are creatures of habit, it helps to get into a routine.32 For example: Exercise at the same time, every day.

- progresses towards the ideal. 
 - is reachable Success spirals A series of "small wins" can give you the confidence you need to expect success.
  When you achieve one challenging goal after another, your obviously gain confidence in your ability to succeed. So: give yourself a series of meaningful, challenging but achievable goals, and then achieve them! Set yourself up for success by doing things you know you can succeed at, again and again, to keep your confidence high. Your brain will reward you with increased expectancy for success.

See Steel (2010a), note 9 in chapter 7.
 Steel (2010a). The Procrastination Equation. New York: Harper.
  Steel recommends that for starters, "it is often best to have process or learning goals rather than product or outcome goals. That is, the goals are acquiring or refining new skills or steps (the process) rather than winning or getting the highest score (the product)."
For example, instead of “Make one new sale every day” (outcome goal) have “Make 20 sales calls a day” (process goal) be your goal. You have complete and direct control over how many sales calls you make. You do not necessarily have complete and direct control over “Make one new sale every day”. However, your process goal should be aligned with your outcome. So if you want to make a new sale every day and you average one close per 20 calls then your process goal of 20 calls per day should get you to your outcome goal.

> The inherent problem with goal setting is related to how the brain works. Recent neuroscience research shows the brain works in a protective way, resistant to change. Therefore, any goals that require substantial behavioural change or thinking-pattern change will automatically be resisted. The brain is wired to seek rewards and avoid pain or discomfort, including fear. When fear of failure creeps into the mind of the goal setter it commences a de-motivator with a desire to return to known, comfortable behaviour and thought patterns. - [Ray Williams](https://business.financialpost.com/executive/careers/why-goal-setting-doesnt-work)

> Goal setting sets up an either-or polarity of success. The only true measure can either be 100% attainment or perfection, or 99% and less, which is failure. We can then excessively focus on the missing or incomplete part of our efforts, ignoring the successful parts. Fourthly, goal setting doesn't take into account random forces of chance. You can't control all the environmental variables to guarantee 100% success - [Ray Williams](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201104/why-goal-setting-doesnt-work)

Increase the size of a task's reward (including both the pleasantness of doing the task and the value of its after-effects), and your motivation goes up. Increase the perceived odds of getting the reward, and your motivation also goes up.

My own behavior baffles me. I find myself doing what I hate, and not doing what I really want to do!

- Saint Paul (Romans 7:15)

https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf

In the renowned 1993 study of young violinists, performance researcher Anders Ericsson found that the best ones all practiced the same way: in the morning, in three increments of no more than 90 minutes each, with a break between each one. Ericcson found the same pattern among other musicians, athletes, chess players and writers.

You need a goal, but we don't want to let your distance from the goal crush you. Break the goal down into parts, so that you can move toward the goal and you have a reasonably high probability of success.

The comparison between the present and the ideal is the inducer of improvement, but is also a judgement. To improve you must first notice a flaw. if there aren't any flaws and sometimes seeing our flaws can be hard.

Ideals require goals  benefits of having an ideal without the crushing blow of the judge that makes you feel insufficient, as well as the power behind incremental self-improvement.

We bring assumptions and knowledge to perception which is why it is such a hard thing to create in machines. Even in simple things there is a hidden complexity covered up by assumptions and knowledge we have already gained.

> Neither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker

Although these lines were first published near the middle of the last century, they unmistakably resonate with the present. Distractions are now pervasive and unrelenting. Our environments have been tailored and cultivated so that they contain addictive stimuli. One antidote to distraction is the practice of Buddhist meditation, which not only strengthens concentration but also develops the power of choice. One learns how and where to place one’s mind. Meditative practice is not a panacea, but it can help those of us who use the Internet navigate its more dangerous pitfalls.

> And the end of all our exploring
> Will be to arrive where we started
> And know the place for the first time.
> ... A condition of complete simplicity

exploration is both necessary and meaningless. Exploration will not give answers, for these will come only when we cease exploring. Yet, had we not made the attempt, we would not be able to rest from exploration, which is what opens the eyes and lets us see, as with new eyes, that which we first could not comprehend.

When we have exhausted the questions (explorations are made up of satisfying questions), we will see that they were based upon a misapprehension. That is why will know the place for the first time. When we do not question it but receive it.

there is new value in old ideas when looked at through the lens of experience.
“The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.”

Marcel Proust

The 8 Elements of Flow
Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced Chick–sent–meehayee) describes eight components of the flow-experience. The first three are basic prerequisites; the other five address the subjective experience during activity in flow.

1. Clarity of goals and immediate feedback
   …as seen in many sports or the arts. A tennis player knows exactly what is required in order to win a game. The rules are clear. In every action, success or failure is immediately perceived. Sports and the arts are therefore classic flow-activities.

2. A high level of concentration on a limited field
   This allows a person's consciousness to delve deeply into the activity. In contrast, there are often chaotic and contradictory demands in daily life which may cause confusion and dissatisfaction.

3. Balance between skills and challenge
   The difficulty of a task has to provide the right degree of challenge to a person’s ability. A too difficult piece of music will leave a musician frustrated and disappointed, a too easy one leads to boredom and routine. So flow occurs in range between ‘too much’ and ‘too little’.

The relationship between requirements and capabilities

4. The feeling of control
   Characteristic for flow is the feeling of heightened control over one’s actions. The expression ‘control’ is easily misunderstood. It can put many people off by its association with compulsive domination or nervous attention. Control in flow has none of these qualities. It is a state of security and relaxation with the complete absence of worry: the paradox known in Zen Buddhism as ‘control without controlling’.

5. Effortlessness
   Flow involves flexibility and ease; everything works harmoniously and effortlessly. A tennis match or a solo performance on stage may look strenuous from the outside; yet, if in fact the player is in flow, he or she does not experience any particular strain. The activity runs smoothly, guided by an inner logic. All necessary decisions arise spontaneously from the demands of the activity without any deliberate reflection.

6. An altered perception of time
   In a deep flow-state, one’s normal perception of time is on hold. Time can either feel condensed - two hours feel like ten minutes, or expanded - seconds feel like minutes. That is why the flow-mode is called ‘timeless’.

7. The melting together of action and consciousness
   Complete involvement creates a state in which there is no room for worry, fear, distraction or self-conscious rumination. Performers do not feel separated from their actions; they are one with their performance. This feeling of unity can expand to a person’s surroundings (nature) as well as to a whole group of people working together (team flow).

8. The autotelic quality of flow-experiences: IROI
   From Greek autos – self and telos – goal. Not only achieving the goal of an activity is rewarding but the activity in itself is fulfilling. Flow is therefore “Immediate Return on Investment”.

Focus on the Process, Not the Event
The second thing you can do to maintain long-term focus is to concentrate on processes, not events. All too often, we see success as an event that can be achieved and completed.

Here are some common examples:

Many people see health as an event: “If I just lose 20 pounds, then I’ll be in shape.”
Many people see entrepreneurship as an event: “If we could get our business featured in the New York Times, then we’d be set.”
Many people see art as an event: “If I could just get my work featured in a bigger gallery, then I’d have the credibility I need.”
Those are just a few of the many ways that we categorize success as a single event. But if you look at the people who stay focused on their goals, you start to realize that it’s not the events or the results that make them different. It’s the commitment to the process. They fall in love with the daily practice, not the individual event.

What’s funny, of course, is that this focus on the process is what will allow you to enjoy the results anyway.

If you want to be a great writer, then having a best-selling book is wonderful. But the only way to reach that result is to fall in love with the process of writing.
If you want the world to know about your business, then it would be great to be featured in Forbes magazine. But the only way to reach that result is to fall in love with the process of marketing.
If you want to be in the best shape of your life, then losing 20 pounds might be necessary. But the only way to reach that result is to fall in love with the process of eating healthy and exercising consistently.
If you want to become significantly better at anything, you have to fall in love with the process of doing it. You have to fall in love with building the identity of someone who does the work, rather than merely dreaming about the results that you want.
Focusing on outcomes and goals is our natural tendency, but focusing on processes leads to more results over the long-run.
