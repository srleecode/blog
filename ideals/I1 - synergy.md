# Synergy

 > Synergy - the bonus that is achieved when things work together harmoniously. - Mark Twain

 > A single arrow is easily broken, but not ten in a bundle

Synergy¹ is when the combined power of a group of things when they are working together is greater than the total power achieved by working separately. A negative synergy² is a destructive interaction between two or more elements where the parts work in a counteractive manner to dampen down or destroy the effects of each other. 

Synergies are derived from systems interacting or systems aligning or a combination of both. 

We might view technologies as human-machine symbiosis extensions of humans (e.g. eye glasses), as tools (e.g. calculators), or as partners (e.g. autonomous robots) or as a new indivisible entity. . Each metaphor suggests a different level of autonomy on the part of the machine.

We might want human extensions to have minimal autonomy, tools somewhere in between, and partners to be relatively self-motivated (but with shared goals).

How the parts interact

Negative synergy
r. Burney relays a conversation he had with a pilot that described to him why airplanes fall out of the sky:

“With the exception of terrorist bombing, very few jetliners ever go down for a single reason. These big planes fail mechanically all the time, and passengers don’t even know it. Crashes occur when, simultaneously, more than one thing goes wrong. For instance, a mechanical failure occurs during a storm, or a system fails and then the backup fails, too. Or a mechanical failure is made worse by a pilot error, or vice versa. Ultimately, planes hit the ground simply because they fall out of the air, and it usually takes a combination of problems to bring one that low.” (page 84-85)
tipping point
themechanical   resilience,   robustness   and   carryingcapacity   of   a   physical   structure   depends   verymuch   on   the   way   its   parts   interact.   This   wasalready known in biology (see example 3.1) but notat his time applied in engineering and architecture.For example, the structures he designed, such asthat in the Figure are much stronger than otherstructures  using  the  same   sub-components  but34
arranged on other ways. This led him to design thegeodesic   dome   which   made   him   famousworldwide. The structures supporting the domeswere much lighter, robust, beautiful and cheaperthan the classical alternatives. Now we know thatnature had invented this structure thousands ofmillions of years before and created “Fullerenes” orcarbon structures using this design.35





Some common ways in which synergy is achieved is through:

- Synchronization or the benefits that accrue from arranging actions in time, space and purpose. For example
  - synchronizing³ a meeting across time so that it is repeated every week at the same time and place.
  - Synchronizing⁴ groups or individuals so that they act in unison to achieve a single objective.
- Complementarity⁵ or co-operating so as to harness complementary skills. This refers to situations where two things reciprocally complete or fulfill a lack in the other. A common example is the division of labor and specialization which lead to opportunities for complementarity and synergistic interactions through the simultaneous execution of tasks that then can be synchronized.
- Solutions that solve a given problem and at the same time stimulate and contribute to the resolution of other problems⁶. For example, instead of doing a task for someone it might be wiser to supervise or teach them how to do the task themselves. This might be a bit slower, but it satisfies two goals at once: it gets the task done and it enables the person to be able to do it for themselves in the future.
- self-organization - Empowering⁷ people so that they can organically self-organise and form synergistic relationships.
of stigmergy, a mechanism for the coordination of actions via the trace they leave in a medium, can explain self-organizing activities in a broad range of domains, including social insects, collaborative websites, and human institutions.

The available dictionaries give us the following definitions for synergy:

- The interaction of two or more agents or forces so that their combined effect is greater than the sum of the individual effects. (The Free Dictionary)
- A state in which two or more things work together in a particularly fruitful way that produces an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects. Expressed also as "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. (Business Dictionary)
- The interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects. ‘the synergy between artist and record company’ (Oxford Dictionaries)
- The creation of a whole that is greater than the simple sum of its parts. The term synergy comes from the Attic Greek word συνεργία “synergia” from synergos, συνεργός, meaning "working together". (Wikipedia)

Mathematicians will never claim that 1 + 1 = 3, but for chemists things are slightly different. Adding up elements in chemistry and inducing chemical reactions produces new compounds that have completely different properties to the isolated constituting elements. We could say that synergistic cooperation and interaction is more like chemistry than mathematics.

In a similar way to how there is technical debt, there is also social debt which is the additional cost occurring through poor socio-technical decisions (e.g. short term, cost externalizing, myopic) which lead to strained social and organisational interactions that get in the way of smooth software development and operation. In a similar way to how technical debt has code smells. Some preliminary socio-technical smells have been discovered which are listed below

Organisational Silo effect
A lack of co-operation and communication produces “operational silos” or isolated sub communities wherein information exchange between different groups is minimal and each group acts on its own.
This smell is caused by a:

- lack of communication
- lack of cooperation in checking task dependencies

It causes:

- wasted resources (e.g., time) and duplication of code
- people to develop a “tunnel vision” with a consequent lack of creativity, lack of cooperation and collaboration.
- developers to make architecture decisions without the necessary background and premises

Black-cloud effect
An inability to understand the perspectives of other teams produces a “black-cloud” of confusing back-and-forth messages which obfuscate reality. This creates confusion every time knowledge exchange initiatives take place.
This smell is caused by a:

- lack of people who are able to bridge the knowledge and experience gaps between different teams
- lack of prescribed occasions for knowledge sharing, e.g. daily stand-ups
- unnecessarily strict Information filtering protocol, e.g., a clearance level, that limits information exchange.
  It causes:
- mistrust
- people taking matters and decisions in their own hands

Prima-donnas effect
Unreceptiveness to change produces severe isolation problems for the people involved. These people become “prima donnas”, acting with a seemingly condescending and egotistical behavior.

This smell is caused by:

- innovation and organisational inertia. For example, a team that deals with legacy products can become unreceptive to change as they would see any prospective change as extremely difficult and would also find it difficult to justify why it is so difficult and costly
- uncooperative or political behavior. This is characterized by the feeling that: “everyone wants to pull the stream towards their own projects and everyone will vote for a decision that simplifies their own agenda”
- stagnant collaboration
- previous failed changes or changes that are perceived as unnecessary or unneeded
  It causes:
- seemingly egotistical behavior
- lack of communication and collaboration

Leftover-techie effect
This is when there are disgruntled operations people who feel a high level of isolation.
This smell is caused by:

- Isolation between development and operations people.
  It causes:
- Drop in morale as technicians to feel like the “last piece of the ladder” and also the “first ones to deal with all complaints from clients”.
- Lack of communication and general lack of trust.
- Seemingly egotistical behavior and misconduct in knowledge and status awareness sharing by the disgruntled technicians.

Sharing villainy
This is where knowledge interaction becomes perceived as a chore, an activity connected more to waste of time and effort than with producing evident benefit. This leads people to no longer recognise the importance of sharing good quality knowledge.

This smell is caused by:

- Lack of knowledge exchange incentives or face-to-face meetings
- High geodispersion
- Tight time constraints
  It causes:
- Low engagement in knowledge sharing, to a point in which shared information is outdated, unconfirmed or wrong.

Organisational Skirmish
Different communication and expertise levels between teams lead to clashes and great difficulties when it comes to integration or knowledge sharing.
This smell is caused by:

- Different communication processes between teams
- Different perspectives and understandings between teams
  It causes:
- Delays and drops in productivity

Architecture hood effect
Architecture decisions are made without accountability, everyone blames the architects.
This smell is caused by:

- Geographcal distance between decision makers and others
- Dispersion of architecture decisions. For example, this happens when decisions are taken in an “architecture board” across which it is difficult to find those directly responsible for decisions and what their reasoning was. This creates social strain when decisions were “questioned” by developers or others.
  It causes:
- A “nobody’s fault” effect from architects as nobody wants to take accountability for the decision and to lead it in its implementation.
- Developers blaming the architecture decisions for any technical mishaps

Solution defiance
Polarization and tribalism produces resistance to the decisions and suggestions of others.
This smell is caused by:

- Different experiences and cultural backgrounds
- Polarization from developers who divide themselves into separate factions with completely conflicting opinions concerning socio-technical or technical decisions to be taken.
  It causes:
- Uncooperative behavior and ignored decisions or only taking decisions into account at the last possible moment

Radio-silence
Extremely formal organisational structures full of “procedures” force changes to be delayed and for information exchange to be filtered.
This smell is caused by:

- highly formal and complex organisational structures
  It causes:
- Delays
- Avoiding checks, queries or additional information as this would cause further delays

The term normally used here is ‘cadence’ which is the use of a regular predictable rhythm within a process. Cadence has three main benefits:

1. Its rhythm transforms unpredictable events into predictable events. Overall cadence inherently makes activities automatic and routine.
2. It limits transaction costs. For example, if review meetings happen every week then there is no coordination overhead in setting up the meeting as everyone knows who will attend and when the meeting will occur. This lowers transaction overhead and leads to other possible benefits, e.g. making it economical to use smaller batch sizes.
3. It limits the accumulation of variance. A canonical example demonstrating the accumulation of variance is the bus bunching problem as shown in the below diagram. The idea here is that a bus that is slightly late will, in addition to its normal load, pick up passengers who would have taken the next bus. These extra passengers cause delays. The next bus, in contrast, now has a lighter passenger load than it would have otherwise and therefore is able to run ahead of its schedule. The bus bunching problem is essentially resolved by reestablishing the cadence, e.g. scheduling minimum and maximum amounts of time at each stop or getting crowded buses to skips stops or to urge passengers to wait for the next bus

In the military, synchronization is recognized as an important concept because it is acknowledged that the synchronized and simultaneous application of several arms, e.g. armor, infantry, artillery and aviation, has greater effects on the enemy than if each arm was used in sequence or against separate objectives. That is, they recognize that military synchronization unlocks synergistic effects. Presumably these arise because:

- Complex systems have thresholds. They are resilient up to a point. Therefore, if the cumulative effects of an attack can overload the opponent's operational ability to recover then it will be much more effective.
- There are decisive points of time and areas in which to attack, e.g. when an opponent is surprised. If you can concentrate your forces to attack at those decisive points, then they will be more effective.
- Synchronized attack unlocks the complementary capabilities of the different arms. For example, using infantry and armor in an urban environment, where one supports the other, or both support each other.

In terms of software development, synchronization can have economic advantages. For example,

- Processing multiple teams at the same time can allows cost advantages through scale economies in processing or through situations where there is higher value in processing multiple items simultaneously, e.g. project reviews or demos.
- Sharing standards, processes and practices can allow the capacity of a team to be more fluid. As teams become able to transfer resources between themselves when one team has a high work load and another does not.

An example of complementarity can be found in wasp’s parental investment. In many wasp species, the females lay eggs in specially built nests wherein the offspring hatches as larvae and are fed by the mother until the larvae metamorphoses into an adult wasp. During that time, the female must both, stay in the nest to guard the brood and defend it against predators (other wasps and spiders), and forage for food (insects) to feed the larvae. Both activities are incompatible. Thus, the odds of a female wasp successfully rearing her broad to adulthood alone are practically zero. Yet, if the female cooperates with another female wasp, rearing both their offspring's and complementing their activities so that when one forages for food the other guards the nest and vice-versa, a synergistic effect ensues. The survival of offspring is then much more than the addition of survivor-ship of each female; it becomes practically 100%. A similar situation has been reported among humans. The survival rates of fetuses and of children increase when the mother profits from cooperation from relatives and/or a spouse.

The complementarity of the two brain hemispheres (left and right) in mammals, and especially in humans, also elicit synergistic properties. Each hemisphere complements the functions of the other and we need both to be full humans and act normally. That is also the case of our two hands (left and right) which complement synergistically their capacities, making a one handed human, irrespective of which hand is missing, is to strongly diminish its capacities.

The most famous examples of synergy through complementarity are found among the large number of symbioses known to exist in nature. The term "symbiosis" is generally used by biologists to connote the "living together" of "dissimilar" organisms for their mutual benefit.

It is important to not be myopic in how one goes about solving problems as we can think about our efforts to resolve problems as falling into one of five categories:

- Destructive effort – for example getting angry and being overly critical to others in your team. This type of effort does not solve any problems and actually make things worse.
- Useless effort or not actually fixing the root cause – for example, implementing a poorly researched solution that doesn’t actually solve the problem. This type of effort is not necessarily destructive and may, on occasion, annul the problem in the short or medium term, but it doesn’t actually fix the problem and so it is wasteful.
- Inhibiting effort – for example, being overly restrictive in how permissions to update systems are given out. This type of effort solves one problem, sometimes really well, but it over-satisfies the problem and as a consequence creates other problems or is overly wasteful
- Singular effort – This type of effort solves one problem and is neutral in respect to other problems. This is the case with most types of effort.
- Synergistic effort - This type of effort solves one problem, but also at the same time stimulates and contributes to the resolution of other problems

Any mismatch in ideals or understandings can be quite difficult to reconcile because communication is, by nature, spurious and ambiguous and people have a strong tendency to want to staunchly defend their viewpoints and beliefs. This all leads to misunderstandings that cause contention, disorder, waste and duplication. This can be extremely costly and can eradicate the majority of benefits that we can gain from working in teams.

One way to resolve these mismatches, what has been the most common way, is dogmatism, to have people at the top define what needs to be done and people at the bottom that are expected to strictly follow orders. Now, this can work fairly well in simplistic situations where the people at the bottom are essentially interchangeable, but it starts to break down when things become more complicated or complex. In situations where expertise is needed or rapid change is required in the face of feedback, you can no longer define everything at the top without incurring heavy repercussions like delays, stagnation and a swelling of discontent from everyone involved.

When there are hierarchies and when there are people at the bottom, it cannot be neglected that those people at the bottom are often better suited to making a wide range of decisions, especially those that need to be done in a timely manner. This is primarily because they are closer to the information from which those decisions should be made. To neglect this is to essentially make your decisions based on dregs, on information that is likely out of date and easily misunderstood as it must explicated from those at the bottom to those at the top.

Unnecessarily forcing decisions to be made at the top is also a major wellspring of contempt and apathy. Because the people at the bottom know, at some level, that they could do things better if only they were trusted enough to try. The manifestation of this discontent is then felt, not just from those at that bottom, but also from those at the top through the low productivity and high staff turnover it produces.

Synergy issues are to a certain extent unavoidable and as organizations grow larger these problems tend to increase and become harder to resolve. Unfortunately, as with most complex problems top-down efforts to resolve them often fail or end up causing large amounts of wasted time and money without much value. This reason for this is because:

- Cooperation and sharing are often set up as ideals that are beyond debate. The goals of synergy programs tend to be expressed in broad, vague terms, e.g. “sharing best practices” or “cross-fertilizing ideas”, and the costs or benefits of such ventures are, therefore, hard to understand and criticize — who, after all, wants to argue against sharing? Fuzzy language obscures and shuts down discussion about the real costs and benefits of the programs. It also tends to undermine implementation as it leads to scattershot, unfocused efforts as different parties impose their own views about what needs to be done to reach the imprecisely stated goals.
- These efforts are often about aligning multiple groups to a common, already perceived, ideal. To be effective they need to be more about integrating different perspectives, understanding when they are useful and when an alternative is better. Only once this is done and the teams agree can you create a new perspective that encompasses the benefits of them all. That is, only when the new way of doing things is perceived as better rather than just a different way of doing things will it be embraced and implemented.
- Synergistic relationships are not formed in a top down manner. To be formed they need exploration and interaction which means that people at the bottom need to be empowered enough to explore and to explore with others. Complex domains have asymmetric payoffs as it is difficult to know beforehand which routes are worth pursuing or valuable. You have to explore them first to find out if they are valuable. This can be seen as wasteful and inefficient when the exploration turns out to not be fruitful. If a comapny is focused on efficiency and people pursuing potentially wasteful things is seen as detrimental or harmful, then it won't be done which will have massive impacts on innovation and synergistic relationships are unlikely to be formed
